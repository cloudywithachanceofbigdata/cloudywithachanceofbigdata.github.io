It is not as if change never existed previously, it did. Innovation and Moore's law have been constant features in technology. However, for decades we had experienced a long period of relativity stability. That is, the rate of change was somewhat fixed. This was largely due to the fact that change, for the most part, was dictated almost entirely by a handful of large companies (such as Oracle, Microsoft, IBM, SAP, etc.). We, the technology community, were exclusively at the mercy of the product management teams at these companies dreaming up the next new feature, and we were subject to the tech giant\u2019s product release cycle as to when we could use this feature. The rate of change was therefore artificially suppressed to a degree."),(0,a.kt)("p",null,"Then along came the open source software revolution. I can recall being fortunate enough to be in a meeting with Steve Ballmer along with a small group of Microsoft partners in Sydney, Australia around 2002. I can remember him as a larger than life figure with a booming voice and an intense presence. I can vividly remember him going on a long diatribe about Open Source Software, primarily focused around Linux. To put some historical context around it, Linux was a fringe technology at best at that point in time \u2013 nobody was taking it seriously in the enterprise. The Apache Software Foundation wasn\u2019t a blip on the radar at the time, Software-as-a-Service was in its infancy, and Platform-as-a-Service and cloud were non-factors \u2013 so what was he worried about?"),(0,a.kt)("p",null,"From the fear instilled in his rant, you would have thought this was going to be the end of humanity as we knew it.

The beginning of the democratisation of change."),(0,a.kt)("p",null,"Fast forward fifteen years, and now everyone is a (potential) software publisher. Real world problems are solved in real companies and in many cases software products are created, published and made (freely) available to other companies. We have seen countless examples of this pattern, Hadoop at Yahoo!, Kafka at LinkedIn, Airflow at Airbnb, to name a few. Then there are companies created with scant capital or investment, driven by a small group of smart people focused on solving a problem or streamlining a process that they have encountered in the real world.
