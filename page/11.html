content="https://fullstackchronicles.io/images/aws-pro-and-specialty-certs.png"><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p>One you get beyond the Associate level AWS certification exams into the Professional or Speciality track exams the degree of difficulty rises significantly. As a veteran of the Certified Solutions Architect Professional and Big Data Specialty exams, I thought I would share my experiences which I believe are applicable to all the certification streams and tracks in the AWS certification program.</p><p>First off let me say that I am a self-professed certification addict, having sat more than thirty technical certification exams over my thirty plus year career in technology including certification and re-certification exams. I would put the AWS professional and specialty exams right up there in terms of their level of difficulty.</p><p>The AWS Professional and Specialty exams are specifically designed to be challenging. Although they have removed the pre-requisites for these exams (much to my dismay…), you really need to be prepared for these exams otherwise you are throwing your hard-earned money away.  </p><p>There are very few - if any - “easy” questions. All of the questions are scenario based and require you to design a solution to meet multiple requirements. The question and/or the correct answer will invariably involve the use of multiple AWS services (not just one). You will be tested on your reading comprehension, time management and ability to cope under pressure as well as being tested on your knowledge of the AWS platform.  </p><p>The following sections provide some general tips which will help you approach the exam and give you the best chance of success on the day. This is not a brain dump or a substitute for the hard work and dedication required to ensure success on your exam day.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_R0VQ" id="time-management">Time Management<a class="hash-link" href="#time-management" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Needless to say, your ability to manage time is critical, on average you will have approximately 2-3 minutes to answer each question. Reading the questions and answers carefully may take up 1-2 minutes on its own. If the answer is not apparent to you, you are best to mark the question and come back to it at the end of the exam.  </p><p>In many cases there may be subsequent questions and answer sets which jog your memory or help you deduce the correct answers to the questions you initial passed on. For instance, you may see references in future questions which put context around services you may not be completely familiar with, this may enable you to answer flagged questions with more confidence.  </p><p>Of course, you must answer all questions before completing the exam, there are no points for incomplete or unattempted answers.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_R0VQ" id="recommended-approach-to-each-question">Recommended Approach to each Question<a class="hash-link" href="#recommended-approach-to-each-question" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Most of the questions on the Professional or Specialty certification exams fall into one of three categories:</p><ul><li>Short-ish question, multiple long detailed answer options</li><li>Long-ish scenario question, multiple relatively short answer options</li><li>Long-ish question with multiple relatively long, detailed answers</li></ul><p>The latter scenario is thankfully less common. However, in all cases it is important to read the last sentence in the question first, this will provide indicators to help you read through the question in its entirety and all of the possible answers with a clear understanding of what is <em>“really”</em> being asked. For instance, the operative phrase may be <em>“highly available”</em> or <em>“most cost effective”</em>.</p><p>Try to eliminate answers based on what you know, for instance answers with erroneous instance families can be eliminated immediately. This will give you a much better statistical chance of success, even if you have to venture an educated guess in the end.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_R0VQ" id="the-most-complicated-solution-is-probably-not-the-correct-one">The Most Complicated Solution is Probably Not the Correct One<a class="hash-link" href="#the-most-complicated-solution-is-probably-not-the-correct-one" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>In many answer sets to questions on the Professional or Specialty exams you will see some ridiculously complicated solution approaches, these are most often incorrect answers. Although there may be enough loosely relevant terminology or services to appear reasonable.</p><p>Note the following statement direct from the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Professional Exam Blueprint:</p><blockquote><p>“Distractors, or incorrect answers, are response options that an examinee with incomplete knowledge or skill would likely choose. However, they are generally plausible responses that fit in the content area defined by the test objective.”</p></blockquote><p>AWS wants professionals who design and implement solutions which are simple, sustainable, highly available, scalable and cost effective. One of the key Amazon Leadership Principles is <em>“Invent and Simplify”</em>, simplify is often the operative word.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_R0VQ" id="dont-spend-time-on-dumps-or-practice-exams-other-than-those-from-aws">Don’t spend time on dumps or practice exams (other than those from AWS)<a class="hash-link" href="#dont-spend-time-on-dumps-or-practice-exams-other-than-those-from-aws" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>The question pools for AWS exams are enormous, the chances of you getting the same questions and answer sets as someone else are slim. Furthermore, non-AWS sources may not be trustworthy. There is no substitute to AWS white papers, how to’s, and real-life application of your learnings.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_R0VQ" id="dont-focus-on-service-limits-or-calculations">Don’t focus on Service Limits or Calculations<a class="hash-link" href="#dont-focus-on-service-limits-or-calculations" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>In my experiences with AWS exams, they are not overly concerned with service limits, default values, formulas (e.g. the formula to calculate required partitions for a DynamoDB table) or syntax - so don’t waste time remembering them. You should however understand the 7 layer OSI model and be able to read and interpret CIDR notation.</p><p>Mainly, however, they want you to understand how services work together in an AWS solution to achieve an outcome for a customer.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_R0VQ" id="some-final-words-of-advice">Some Final Words of Advice<a class="hash-link" href="#some-final-words-of-advice" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p><strong>Always do what you think AWS would want you to do!</strong> </p><p>It is worthwhile having a quick look at the <a href="https://blog.aboutamazon.com.au/amazon-in-australia/our-leadership-principles" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS Leadership Principles</a> (I have already referenced one of these in this article) as these are applied religiously in every aspect of the AWS business.  In particular, you should pay specific attention to the principals around simplicity and frugality.</p><p><strong>Good luck!</strong></p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_XVD_ padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_JSN8"><a class="tag_hD8n tagRegular_D6E_" href="/tags/aws">aws</a></li><li class="tag_JSN8"><a class="tag_hD8n tagRegular_D6E_" href="/tags/certification">certification</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="blogPostTitle_rzP5" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/gcp-networking-for-aws-professionals">GCP Networking for AWS Professionals</a></h2><div class="blogPostData_Zg1s margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2019-02-21T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">February 21, 2019</time> · <!-- -->4 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_FlmR"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><span class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffreyaven/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="image_o0gy" src="https://s.gravatar.com/avatar/f96573d092470c74be233e1dded5376f?s=80" alt="Jeffrey Aven"></a></span><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffreyaven/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Jeffrey Aven</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Technologist and Cloud Consultant</small></div></div></div></div></header><meta itemprop="image" content="https://fullstackchronicles.io/images/gcp-aws-networking.png"><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p>GCP and AWS share many similarities, they both provide similar services and both leverage containerization, virtualization and software defined networking.</p><p>There are some significant differences when it comes to their respective implementations, networking is a key example of this.</p><p>Before we compare and contrast the two different approaches to networking, it is worthwhile noting the genesis of the two major cloud providers.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_R0VQ" id="google-was-born-to-be-global-amazon-became-global"><em>Google was born to be global, Amazon became global</em><a class="hash-link" href="#google-was-born-to-be-global-amazon-became-global" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>By no means am I suggesting that Amazon didn&#x27;t have designs on going global from it&#x27;s beginnings, but AWS was driven (entirely at the beginning) by the needs of the Amazon eCommerce business. Amazon started in the US before expanding into other regions (such as Europe and Australia). In some cases the expansion took decades (Amazon only entered Australia as a retailer in 2018).</p><p>Google, by contrast, was providing application, search and marketing services worldwide from its very beginning. GCP which was used as the vector to deliver these services and applications was architected around this global model, even though their actual data centre expansion may not have been as rapid as AWS’s (for example GCP opened its Australia region 5 years after AWS).</p><p>Their respective networking implementations reflect how their respective companies evolved.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_R0VQ" id="aws-is-a-leader-in-iaas-gcp-is-a-leader-in-paas"><em>AWS is a leader in IaaS, GCP is a leader in PaaS</em><a class="hash-link" href="#aws-is-a-leader-in-iaas-gcp-is-a-leader-in-paas" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>This is only an opinion and may be argued, however if you look at the chronology of the two platforms, consider this:</p><ul><li>The first services released by AWS (simultaneously for all intents and purposes) were S3, SQS and EC2</li><li>The first service released by Google was AppEngine (a pure PaaS offering)</li></ul><p>Google has launched and matured their IaaS offerings since as AWS has done similarly with their PaaS offerings, but they started from much different places.</p><p>With all of that said, here are the key differences when it comes to networking between the two major cloud providers:</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_R0VQ" id="gcp-vpcs-are-global-by-default-aws-vpcs-are-regional-only">GCP VPCs are Global by default, AWS VPCs are Regional only<a class="hash-link" href="#gcp-vpcs-are-global-by-default-aws-vpcs-are-regional-only" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>This is the first fundamental difference between the two providers. Each GCP project is allocated one VPC network with Subnets in each of the 18 GCP Regions. Whereas each AWS Account is allocated one Default VPC in each AWS Region with a Subnet in each AWS Availability Zone for that Region, that is each account has 17 VPCs in each of the 17 Regions (excluding GovCloud regions).</p><p><a target="_blank" href="/assets/files/gcp-default-network-bb8c3f62583663e872cc53948671005f.png"><img loading="lazy" alt="Default Global VPC Network in GCP" src="/assets/images/gcp-default-network-bb8c3f62583663e872cc53948671005f.png" width="1920" height="1080" class="img_E7b_"></a></p><p>It is entirely possible to create VPCs in GCP which are Regional, but they are Global by default.</p><p>This global tenancy can be advantageous in many cases, but can be limiting in others, for instance there is a limit of 25 peering connections to any one VPC, the limit in AWS is 125.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_R0VQ" id="gcp-subnets-are-regional-aws-subnets-are-zonal">GCP Subnets are Regional, AWS Subnets are Zonal<a class="hash-link" href="#gcp-subnets-are-regional-aws-subnets-are-zonal" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Subnets in GCP automatically span all Zones in a Region, whereas AWS VPC Subnets are assigned to Availability Zones in a Region. This means you are abstracted from some of the networking and zonal complexity, but you have less control over specific network placement of instances and endpoints. You can infer from this design that Zones are replicated or synchronised within a Region, making them less of a direct consideration for High Availability (or at least as much or your concern as they otherwise would be).</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_R0VQ" id="all-gcp-firewall-rules-are-stateful">All GCP Firewall Rules are Stateful<a class="hash-link" href="#all-gcp-firewall-rules-are-stateful" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>AWS Security Groups are stateful firewall rules – meaning they maintain connection state for inbound connections, AWS also has Network ACLs (NACLs) which are stateless firewall rules.

For instance, GCP Firewall Rules can include Deny actions which is not an option with AWS Security Group Rules.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_R0VQ" id="load-balancers-in-gcp-are-layer-4-tcpudp-unless-they-are-public-facing">Load Balancers in GCP are layer 4 (TCP/UDP) unless they are public facing<a class="hash-link" href="#load-balancers-in-gcp-are-layer-4-tcpudp-unless-they-are-public-facing" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>AWS Application Load Balancers can be deployed in private VPCs with no external IPs attached to them.

Often, however, this aspiration goes unrealised as it tends to slide down the priority scale as we still grapple with legacy batch oriented integration patterns and processes.</p><p>Event processing is not a new concept, real time event and transaction processing has been a standard feature for security, digital and operations functions for some time, however in the Data Warehousing, BI and Advanced Analytics worlds it is often spoken about but rarely implemented, except for tech companies of course. In many cases personalization is still a batch oriented process, e.g. train a model from a feature set built from historical data, generate recommendations in batch, serve these recommendations upon the next visit - wash, rinse, and repeat.</p><p>Lambda has existed for several years now as a data-processing architecture pattern designed to incorporate both batch and stream-processing capabilities. Moreover, messaging platforms have existed for decades, from point-to-point messaging systems, to message-oriented-middleware systems, to distributed pub-sub messaging systems such as Apache Kafka.</p><p>Additionally, open source streaming data processing frameworks and tools have proliferated in recent years with projects such as Storm, Samza, Flink and Spark Streaming becoming established solutions.</p><p>Kafka in particular, with its focus on durability, resiliency, availability and consistency, has graduated into fully fledged data platform <strong>not simply a transient messaging system</strong>. In many cases Kafka is serving as a back end for operational processes, such as applications implementing the CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) design pattern.  </p><p>In other words, it is not the technology that holds us back, it&#x27;s our lack of imagination.</p><p>Enter <a href="http://milinda.pathirage.org/kappa-architecture.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kappa Architecture</a> where we no longer have to attempt to integrate streaming data with batch processes…<strong>everything is a stream</strong>. The ultimate embodiment of Kappa Architecture is the <strong><em>Streaming Data Warehouse</em></strong>.</p><p>In the Streaming Data Warehouse, tables are represented by topics. Topics represent either:</p><ul><li>unbounded event or change streams; or</li><li>stateful representations of data (such as master, reference or summary data sets).</li></ul><p>This approach makes possible the enrichment and/or summarisation of transaction or event data with master or reference data. Furthermore many of the patterns used in data warehousing and master data management are inherent in Kafka as you can represent the current state of an object as well as the complete change history of that object (in other words change data capture and associated slowly changing dimensions from one inbound stream).</p><p>Data is acquired from source systems either in real time or as a scheduled extract process, <strong>in either case the data is presented to Kafka as a stream</strong>.</p><p>The Kafka Avro Schema Registry provides a systematic contract with source systems which also serves as a data dictionary for consumers supporting schema evolution with backward and forward compatibility. Data is retained on the Kafka platform for a designated period of time (days or weeks) where it is available for applications and processes to consume - these processes can include data summarisation or sliding window operations for reporting or notification, or data integration or datamart building processes which sink data to other systems - these could include relational or non-relational data stores.</p><p>Real time applications can be built using the KStreams API and emerging tools such as KSQL can be used to provide a well-known interface for sampling streaming data or performing windowed processing operations on streams. Structured Streaming in Spark or Spark Streaming in its original RDD/DStream implementation can be used to prepare and enrich data for machine learning operations using Spark ML or Spark MLlib.  </p><p>In addition, data sinks can operate concurrently to sink datasets to S3 or Google Cloud Storage or both (multi cloud - like real time analytics - is something which is talked about more than it’s implemented…).</p><p>In the Streaming Data Warehouse architecture Kafka is much more than a messaging platform it is a distributed data platform, which could easily replace major components of a legacy (or even a modern) data architecture.  </p><p>It just takes a little imagination…</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_XVD_ padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_JSN8"><a class="tag_hD8n tagRegular_D6E_" href="/tags/data-warehousing">data-warehousing</a></li><li class="tag_JSN8"><a class="tag_hD8n tagRegular_D6E_" href="/tags/kafka">kafka</a></li><li class="tag_JSN8"><a class="tag_hD8n tagRegular_D6E_" href="/tags/kappa-architecture">kappa-architecture</a></li><li class="tag_JSN8"><a class="tag_hD8n tagRegular_D6E_" href="/tags/stream-processing">stream-processing</a></li><li class="tag_JSN8"><a class="tag_hD8n tagRegular_D6E_" href="/tags/streaming-analytics">streaming-analytics</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="blogPostTitle_rzP5" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/test-driven-infrastructure-and-test-automation-with-ansible-molecule-and-azure">Test Driven Infrastructure and Test Automation with Ansible, Molecule and Azure</a></h2><div class="blogPostData_Zg1s margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2019-01-31T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">January 31, 2019</time> · <!-- -->5 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_FlmR"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><span class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><a href="https://github.com/datwiz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="image_o0gy" src="http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/f9af9c3fae755ac170c5798c53c5267d?s=80" alt="Chris Ottinger"></a></span><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/datwiz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Chris Ottinger</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Senior Technologist</small></div></div></div></div></header><meta itemprop="image" content="https://fullstackchronicles.io/images/molecule-ansible-azure.png"><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p>A few years back, before the rise of the hyper-scalers, I had my first infracode &#x27;aha moment&#x27; with OpenStack.

Allow me to present a slight twist (pardon the pun…) on this statement.</p><p>Cognac is a variety of brandy named after the town of Cognac, France. It is distilled from a white wine grown from grapes in the area. The wine used to make Cognac is characterised as &quot;virtually undrinkable&quot;. However in its distilled form, Cognac is considered to be the world&#x27;s most refined spirit. With bottles of high end Cognac fetching as much as $200,000.</p><p>The area surrounding the town of Cognac was a recognised wine-growing area dating back to the third century, however when it was evident that the grapes produced in the town of Cognac itself were unsuitable for wine making, local producers developed the practice of double distillation in copper pot stills and ageing in oak barrels for at least two years. The product yielded was the spirit we now know as Cognac.</p><p>Fast forward 15 centuries to Scotland in the 1800’s, where John Walker was a humble shopkeeper. Local whiskey producers would bring John different varieties of single malt whiskeys, many of them below an acceptable standard. Instead of on selling these varieties – he began blending them as made-to-order whiskies, blended to meet specific customer requirements. From this idea a product (and subsequently one of the most globally recognised brands) was created which would last over 200 years.</p><p><strong>Interesting, but what does this have to do with technology you might ask?</strong></p><p>Ingenuity and resourcefulness have existed for as long as man has, but in the realm of technology and in particular cloud computing and open source software it has never been more imperative. We are continually faced with challenges on each assignment or project, often technology not working as planned or as advertised, or finding dead ends when trying to solve problems. This is particularly evident now as software and technology are moving at such an accelerated rate.</p><p>To be successful in this era you need creativity and lateral thinking. You need an ability not just to solve problems to which there are no documented solutions, but to create new products from existing ones which are not necessarily suitable for your specific objective. In many cases, looking to add value in the process. That is not just making lemonade from lemons (which anyone could think of) but making Cognac from sub-standard grapes or premium blended whiskey from sub-standard single malt whiskies.</p><p>One of my favourite Amazon Leadership Principles is <strong><em>“Invent and Simplify”</em></strong>:</p><blockquote><p><em>Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by “not invented here&quot;. As we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.</em></p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.jobs/en/principles" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>https:</strong></em><strong>//www.amazon.jobs/en/principles</strong></a>  </p></blockquote><p>The intent in this statement is not simply to “lift and shift” current on premise systems and processes to the cloud, but to look for ways to streamline, rationalise and simplify processes in doing so. This mandates a combination of practicality and creativity.</p><p>The take away is when you are presented with a challenge, be creative and inventive and not just solve the problem but look for ways to add value in the process.</p><p>Cheers!</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_XVD_ padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_JSN8"><a class="tag_hD8n tagRegular_D6E_" href="/tags/cloud">cloud</a></li><li class="tag_JSN8"><a class="tag_hD8n tagRegular_D6E_" href="/tags/creativity">creativity</a></li><li class="tag_JSN8"><a class="tag_hD8n tagRegular_D6E_" href="/tags/lateral-thinking">lateral-thinking</a></li><li class="tag_JSN8"><a class="tag_hD8n tagRegular_D6E_" href="/tags/open-source-software">open-source-software</a></li><li class="tag_JSN8"><a class="tag_hD8n tagRegular_D6E_" href="/tags/technology">technology</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav" aria-label="Blog list page navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/page/10"><div class="pagination-nav__label">Newer Entries</div></a></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/page/12"><div class="pagination-nav__label">Older Entries</div></a></div></nav></main></div></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Blog</div><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/">Home</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/archive">Archive</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/tags">Tags</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Sponsors</div><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://stackql.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">StackQL<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_I5OW"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://gammadata.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Gamma Data<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_I5OW"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://www.windrate.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">WindRate<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_I5OW"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">More</div><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/stackql/fullstackchronicles.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">GitHub<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_I5OW"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li></ul></div></div></div></footer></div>
