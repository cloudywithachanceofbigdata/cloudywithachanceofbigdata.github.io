Following on from the recent post [GCP Templates for C4 Diagrams using PlantUML](https://cloudywithachanceofbigdata.com/gcp-templates-for-c4-diagrams-using-plantuml/), cloud architects are often challenged with producing diagrams for architectures spanning multiple cloud providers, particularly as you elevate to enterprise level diagrams.

In this post, with the magic of `!includeurl` we have brought PlantUML template libraries together for AWS, Azure and GCP icon sets, allowing us to produce multi cloud C4 diagrams using PlantUML like this one:

Multi Cloud Architecture Diagram using PlantUML

Creating a multi cloud diagram is simple, start by adding the following `include` statements after the `@startuml` label in a new PlantUML C4 diagram:

Then add references to the required services from different providersâ€¦

Then include the predefined resources from your different cloud providers in your diagram as shown here (describing a client server application over a cloud to cloud VPN between Azure and GCP)...

Happy multi-cloud diagramming!
