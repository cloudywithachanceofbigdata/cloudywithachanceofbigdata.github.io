Snowflake allows roles to be assigned to other roles, so when a user is assigned to a role, they may inherit the ability to use countless other roles.

**Challenge:** recursively enumerate all roles for a given user

One solution would be to create a complex query on the `â€œSNOWFLAKE"."ACCOUNT_USAGE"."GRANTS_TO_ROLES"` object.

An easier solution is to use a stored procedure to recurse through grants for a given user and return an `ARRAY` of roles for that user.

This is a good programming exercise in tail call recursion (sort of) in JavaScript. Here is the code:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/9b9985dbf8163ade22b71f2ccf20cb51.js"></script>

To call the stored proc, execute:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/fbbfaa3b67af828e4d905411567cd031.js"></script>

One drawback of stored procedures in Snowflake is that they can only have scalar or array return types and cannot be used directly in a SQL query, however you can use the `table(result_scan(last_query_id()))` trick to get around this, as shown below where we will pivot the `ARRAY` into a record set with the array elements as rows:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/6a7e8bc552b87ab1e039f22bacf1b65f.js"></script>

IMPORTANT

This query **must** be the next statement run immediately after the `CALL` statement and cannot be run again until you run another `CALL` statement.

More adventures with Snowflake soon!
