There are many posts available which map analogous services between the different cloud providers, but this post attempts to go a step further and map additional concepts, terms, and configuration options to be the definitive thesaurus for cloud practitioners familiar with AWS looking to fast track their familiarisation with GCP.

It should be noted that AWS and GCP are fundamentally different platforms, nowhere is this more apparent than in the way networking is implemented between the two providers, see:

https://cloudywithachanceofbigdata.com/gcp-networking-for-aws-professionals/

This post is focused on the core infrastructure, networking and security services offered by the two major cloud providers, I will do a future post on higher level services such as the ML/AI offerings from the respective providers.

Furthermore this will be a living post which I will continue to update, I encourage comments from readers on additional mappings which I will incorporate into the post as well.

I have broken this down into sections based upon the layout of the AWS Console.
